**An anti-fragile agent swarm. Kill one head, two grow back — carrying the dead head's memory and a permanent defense against whatever just killed it.**

> Live now → **https://hydra.hacklabs.in/dashboard** · 3 heads on AXL mesh · 4 contracts on 0G Galileo · scars mint as iNFTs.

**Production execution + learning layer for autonomous agent fleets.** When agents fail, the swarm doesn't just respawn them — it inherits their memory and a learned defense against the failure mode. Every attack hardens the network.

---

## The problem

Today's agent fleets — yield bots, keeper networks, automated treasuries, agentic DeFi — are uniformly fragile. One revoked API key, one process crash, one RPC timeout, one drained EOA, and the position the agent was managing collapses. Worse: the rest of the fleet learns nothing. Every team rebuilds the same incident response from scratch.

HYDRA is the layer underneath those agents. Each head runs the strategy you'd run anyway (Aave deposit, Uniswap LP, scheduled payroll), but it does so as a member of a peer-to-peer swarm with three properties:

1. **Availability bounded by minutes, not days.** When a head dies, the swarm reaches consensus on the cause within ~15s and a leader spawns two replacements within another ~30s. Total downtime per head: <60 seconds.
2. **Memory inherited across deaths.** Children read the dead head's last `HeadState` snapshot from 0G Storage on boot. Position, balance, strategy, generation — none of it is lost.
3. **Failures become permanent immune responses.** Every confirmed death writes a defense rule (`scar`) to a global stream and mints it as an iNFT on 0G Chain. Every surviving and future head reads it on boot. The swarm gets *smarter every time it gets attacked*, and the rule is publicly auditable as ERC-721 metadata anyone can inherit.

Agent operators get bounded downtime + cumulative immunity. Treasuries don't get drained — funds live in a constrained `HydraTreasury`, never in head EOAs, with execution gated behind a whitelist of (target, selector) pairs. A compromised head cannot route value anywhere except back to the treasury.

**iNFT — intelligence embedded on chain.** Every learned defense rule mints
a `HydraScars` token whose `tokenURI` returns on-chain JSON: the cause that
killed the parent, the mitigation rule the swarm now carries, the generation
that learned it, and the head it was learned from. The "intelligence" of
the swarm — its accumulated defenses against attack — is therefore publicly
auditable as ERC-721 metadata. Anyone can fetch a scar, read the rule, and
inherit the swarm's hard-earned lessons.

### Live attack — captured 2026-04-28 11:52 UTC

A `process_killed` attack on head-2 (`f17413e0…`, univ4_lp strategy) on the
`hydra.hacklabs.in` deployment. Total elapsed: detection at +15.3 s, full
on-chain settlement at +24 s. All five tx hashes are pinned below for
independent verification on chainscan-galileo.

After resurrection: 4 heads alive (2 originals + 2 gen-1 children), AUM
0.004 OG, valueProtectedWei 0.001 OG (head-2's position survived its EOA),
1 scar inherited swarm-wide.

```

**The death ritual:** attack → head process dies → AXL `/recv` stops returning
heartbeats from that peer → after 15 s scanner triggers `suspect` broadcast →
quorum (⌈n/2⌉+1) reaches `confirmed` with cause from latest panic → leader
(lowest-peer-id) writes scar to 0G global stream + broadcasts → mints iNFT
on `HydraScars` → spawns 2 children with fresh ed25519 keys → children boot,
inherit dead head's state from 0G KV, call 0G Compute (TEE-verified) for an
action signal → KeeperHub workflow gets a webhook with the full payload for
external audit. End state: swarm went 3 → 4 (one dead, two born), every
surviving + future head now carries the new defense rule.

## How it works

1. **AXL mesh** — each head runs its own Gensyn AXL Go node (separate process, distinct ed25519 peer-id, listens on its own TLS port). Heartbeats are signed and routed peer-to-peer every 3 seconds — no central broker.
2. **Consensus** — when a peer misses 5 heartbeats (15s), surviving heads broadcast `suspect` messages. When ⌈n/2⌉+1 heads agree, the lowest-peer-id leader broadcasts `confirmed` with the inferred death cause.
3. **Memory on 0G Storage** — every head persists `HeadState` snapshots and event logs to 0G Storage. Children inherit this on boot. Scars (defense rules) are persisted to a global stream all heads read on startup.
4. **Resurrection** — leader generates two fresh ed25519 keypairs, writes AXL configs, spawns two AXL Go sidecars, then spawns two Node head processes with `PARENT_ID` env var. Children boot, read parent's last state from 0G, broadcast `born`, join the mesh.
5. **TEE-verified inference** — children call `0G Compute` once on boot via `@0glabs/0g-serving-broker`. The response is verified via `processResponse` (TeeML / TeeTLS attestation) so the swarm's "should I act?" decision is provably honest compute.
6. **iNFT scar minting** — every learned defense rule mints an ERC-721-like NFT on `HydraScars` (chain 16602). Each token's metadata embeds the cause + mitigation rule on chain — auditable by judges.
7. **KeeperHub audit trail** — leader fires a webhook to a KeeperHub workflow on every confirmed death. The workflow logs the death payload + audit record in run history (the prize criterion's "audit trail").
8. **Whitelisted execution** — funds live in `HydraTreasury`, never in head EOAs. `HydraExecutor` permits only `(target, selector)` pairs explicitly whitelisted by the owner. A compromised head's key cannot drain the treasury — it can only call functions that route value back to the treasury.

## Performance bounds

The swarm holds these bounds across every kill in our test runs. Numbers are measured from the dashboard's `events.jsonl` stream, not asserted.

| Phase | Bound | What's happening |
|---|---|---|
| Detection | < 18 s | 5 missed 3-s heartbeats over the AXL mesh trigger `suspect` broadcast |
| Quorum + cause attribution | < 24 s | ⌈n/2⌉+1 heads agree, leader pulls cause from latest panic message |
| Spawn + scar broadcast | < 45 s | Two children, fresh ed25519 keys, AXL configs written, joined mesh |
| Treasury redeposit on chain | < 60 s | KeeperHub-routed call lands in `HydraTreasury`, dashboard ticks |
| iNFT mint (scar metadata) | next block | `HydraScars.mintScar(...)` writes cause + rule on chain |

Drain defense is independent of these timings — see "Common Questions" below.

---

## Common Questions

> *Sponsor reviewers ask these in 30 seconds. Pre-empted here so they don't have to ask.*

**"If a drain takes 2 seconds and detection takes 18, isn't HYDRA useless?"**
HYDRA is not the drain defense. The drain defense lives in `HydraExecutor.sol` — a whitelist of `(target, selector)` pairs that excludes every value-routing call except those that route value *back* to `HydraTreasury`. Funds never live in head EOAs. A compromised head's signing key cannot move value to an attacker — it can only call `Aave.supply(treasury,...)` or `Aave.withdraw(to=treasury)`. Whitelist stops theft in under one block. HYDRA stops *downtime* in under a minute. Two different layers, both required.

**"Why three sponsors and not five or seven?"**
Open Agents caps every project at three sponsor opt-ins. Adding more would force dropping one of these three, which collapses the architecture: KeeperHub without AXL becomes centralized execution; AXL without 0G becomes amnesia (every death wipes memory); 0G without KeeperHub leaves on-chain actions unaudited. Each integration is load-bearing. The three-sponsor cap is a discipline, not a limit.

**"Why does each head get its own AXL Go process — isn't that overkill?"**
Per Gensyn AXL's prize criteria, "cross-node communication" must mean *separate AXL nodes*, not one process pretending to be three. Three Go binaries on ports 9001 / 9011 / 9021, three distinct ed25519 peer-ids, three TLS-encrypted Yggdrasil tunnels. If we lose this, we lose the AXL prize.

**"What stops the 'leader' from cheating during resurrection?"**
The leader is whoever has the lowest live peer-id at the moment of confirmed death — deterministic, not elected. Every head independently runs `evaluateQuorum()` and reaches the same conclusion. If the leader fails to act, the next-lowest peer-id picks up. Children's first action is to call 0G Compute (TEE-attested via TeeML) for an action signal, so even the leader's spawn decision is verifiable.

**"Why hardcode the scar lookup table instead of generating rules with an LLM?"**
Demo determinism. An LLM-generated rule on stage during a 2:45 demo is one hallucination away from a non-recoverable failure. The four causes (`key_revoked` / `process_killed` / `api_timeout` / `wallet_drained`) and their mitigations are fixed in `agents/src/scars.ts`. Adding LLM-authored rules is a v2 concern.

**"How is the iNFT 'intelligence' actually intelligent — isn't it just metadata?"**
Each `HydraScars` token's `tokenURI` returns on-chain JSON describing the cause that killed a parent and the mitigation rule the swarm now carries. Any future agent — not just HYDRA's — can read those tokens and inherit the defense. The "intelligence" of the swarm is therefore portable, public, and ERC-721-composable. It is the antibody, not just the receipt.

---

## Sponsors

| Sponsor | Role | Code |
|---|---|---|
| **Gensyn AXL** | P2P signed messaging across 3 separate Go nodes — heartbeat, suspect, confirmed, scar, born, panic | `agents/src/axl/`, `configs/h*.json` |
| **0G** | Storage (head state + global scars), Compute (TEE inference per resurrection), Chain (4 deployed contracts). Submitting to **both** 0G tracks: *Best Autonomous Agents, Swarms & iNFT Innovations* and *Best Agent Framework, Tooling & Core Extensions*. | `agents/src/memory/`, `contracts/contracts/`, `agents/src/execution/chain.ts` |
| **KeeperHub** | Workflow orchestration (webhook trigger on confirmed death) + audit run history | `agents/src/execution/keeperhub.ts`, KH workflow `lcyuk85gh46defy5xaq8b` |

Each sponsor is load-bearing: without AXL the anti-fragility is centralized; without 0G death means amnesia; without KeeperHub the redistribution lacks an auditable third-party trail.

## Setup (local)

Prerequisites: Node 22+, Go 1.21+, an OG-funded wallet on 0G Galileo testnet.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mithran-MV/Hydra.git
cd Hydra
npm install

# 0G testnet wallet — paste your private key (never commit)
cp .env.example .env
# edit .env: OG_CHAIN_PK=0x...

# build the AXL Go binary
git clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/axl /tmp/axl-src && (cd /tmp/axl-src && make build) && cp /tmp/axl-src/node axl/bin/axl-node

# generate 5 ed25519 keys (3 originals + 2 children reserves)
mkdir -p keys
for i in 1 2 3; do /opt/homebrew/opt/openssl/bin/openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out keys/h$i.pem; done

# end-to-end demo
./demo/full-demo.sh --cause key_revoked
open http://localhost:3000/dashboard
```

Kill a head manually:

```bash
./demo/kill.sh 2 --cause api_timeout
```

Reset (wipe runtime state):

```bash
./demo/reset.sh --hard
```

## Setup (VPS — full swarm + dashboard)

The live deployment at `https://hydra.hacklabs.in` runs the swarm + dashboard on a single Ubuntu 24.04 host (4 vCPU, 8 GB RAM). systemd manages 7 units: 3 AXL Go nodes, 3 head Node processes, 1 Next.js web service. nginx reverse-proxies port 3000 with Let's Encrypt SSL.

```bash
# bootstrap a fresh Ubuntu host
apt-get install -y nodejs go nginx certbot python3-certbot-nginx
git clone https://github.com/Mithran-MV/Hydra.git /var/www/hydra
cd /var/www/hydra
npm ci

# build AXL binary (linux/amd64) from source
git clone https://github.com/gensyn-ai/axl /tmp/axl-src
(cd /tmp/axl-src && GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.25.5 make build)
mkdir -p axl/bin && cp /tmp/axl-src/node axl/bin/axl-node

# build the dashboard
npm run build --workspace=web

# copy your .env (OG_CHAIN_PK, contract addresses, KH webhook URLs)
# then enable + start the systemd units (templates in deploy/systemd/)
systemctl enable --now hydra-axl@1.service hydra-axl@2.service hydra-axl@3.service
systemctl enable --now hydra-head1.service hydra-head2.service hydra-head3.service
systemctl enable --now hydra-web.service

# nginx + cert
ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/hydra.hacklabs.in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
certbot --nginx -d <your-domain>
```

Logs land in `/var/www/hydra/logs/{axl-h*,head-h*,web}.log` and the dashboard event stream is `/var/www/hydra/logs/events.jsonl`.
